## Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 or commonly known as Covid-19, is a contagious viral infection that started to emerge in China at the end of 2019 and then quickly swept through the world like wildfires. This pandemic had forever changed the world both socially and economically. To win the battle against the virus, finding a way to reliably detect and confirm the cases has become the key. Recent work has shown that AI researchers around the globe had experimented with various deep learning techniques to help detect the cases from peopleâ€™s lung X-ray images. Among the models used by the AI researchers, the transfer learning models were popular choices and yielded great results in the testing datasets. In this paper, we conduct 2 studies aimed at improving model performance. In Study 1, we evaluate 6 base transfer learning models with a comprehensive dataset of X-ray images. In Study 2, using DenseNet121 as the base model, we evaluate 3 proposed model architectures: DensePlus, ConvolutionPlus, and DC Plus which combines a dense and convolution modeling approach.
